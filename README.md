The following data analysis evaluates the potential relationship between motor vehicle related deaths and gas prices. The two data sets being used have been web scraped and collected from the “Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Highway Loss Data Institute (IIHS HLDI),”  and the, “U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).” In 2018, the IIHS HLDI published the results from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s annual motor vehicle death census with the intention of evaluating the impact of motor vehicle deaths on American public health while also evaluating the change in car related deaths between 1975 and 2018. Each week during the year, the EIA updates the average cost of a gallon of gasoline in the United States to track the change in gasoline prices across multiple decades, particularly from April 1993 to present day. Through comparing the observed trends and relationships in both data sets, as well as simply comparing raw data, I have focused on answering the research question: What impact does (the change in) gas prices have on (the rate of) annual motor vehicle related deaths in the United States? My main findings are: motor vehicle deaths and gas prices have negative, low correlations, and vehicle deaths appear to decline with the increase in gas prices.
